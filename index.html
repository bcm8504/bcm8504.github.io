        <p>Hi! My name is Brandon Montijo.</p>
        <p>
            I currently study at RIT, and expect to graduate by May 2024 with a bachelors 
            degree in Software Engineering. I will be seeking an internship in Software
            Engineering or Quantitative Development for Fall 2022 and Summer 2023.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. I enjoy cooking (and eating), classical piano, golf,
            chess, and following financial markets. In the past, I've enjoyed baseball, 
            basketball, table tennis, and surfing.
