        <p>Hi! My name is Brandon Montijo.</p>
        <p>
            I currently study at RIT, and expect to graduate by May 2024 with a bachelors 
            degree in Software Engineering. I am seeking an internship in Software 
            Engineering or Quantitative Development starting January 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. I enjoy cooking (and eating), classical piano, golf, and 
            following global markets. In the past, I've enjoyed baseball, basketball, chess, 
            table tennis, and surfing.
