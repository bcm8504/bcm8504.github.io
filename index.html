        <p>Hi! My name is Brandon Montijo.</p>
        <p>
            I currently study at RIT, and expect to graduate by May 2024 with a bachelors 
            degree in Software Engineering. I am currently open for Software Engineering
            internship roles beginning in September 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
            My hobbies come and go. I enjoy cooking (and eating), chess, piano, golf, 
            hiking, and following financial markets. In the past, I've enjoyed baseball, 
            basketball, table tennis, and wakesurfing.

            My <a href="https://github.com/brandonmontijo" target="_blank">GitHub</a> profile, but most of the projects I own and work on are in private repos.
